# Art Generator iOS app

## Overview
This is a simple iOS app that makes API calls to OpenAI's DALL-E 2 image generation model and displays the resulting images, with a few additional features.

## Features
- The user can input an image description, and then optionally pick a few modifiers such as art style, image medium, and artist style.
- Upon pressing "Fetch", the app calls the OpenAI API, and displays 4 images created by the model.
- The user can then tap each image to view it in a larger size, or share it with friends.
- The user can also tap a generated image and request DALL-E to generate more images that are similar to this source image.
